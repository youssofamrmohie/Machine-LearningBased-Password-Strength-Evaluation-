# Machine Learning–Based Password Strength Evaluation
This project is a password strength evaluation system that leverages over 14 million leaked RockYou passwords, an XGBoost regression model, and a React-based interface to provide accurate, data-driven assessments of password security.

Passwords are a fundamental pillar of internet security, required for access to nearly every online service and digital activity. Despite strict, rule-based policies enforced by most platforms, many passwords remain vulnerable to automated attacks, as they can be easily guessed by algorithmic methods. Traditional cracking tools like Hashcat and John the Ripper are now supplemented by advanced probabilistic modeling techniques, such as Probabilistic Context‑Free Grammar (PCFG).

This system addresses these challenges by applying extensive feature engineering on the RockYou dataset and training an XGBoost regression model with over twenty features, providing a reliable and practical method to evaluate password strength based on real-world cracking techniques.
