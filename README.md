# Machine Learning–Based Password Strength Evaluation
Passwords represent one of the most fundamental pillars of internet security, as they are required for access to nearly every online service and digital activity. Over time, numerous tools and techniques for cracking passwords have been developed, such as Hashcat and John the Ripper, which, although powerful, are now being supplemented by more advanced probabilistic modeling techniques, such as Probabilistic Context‑Free Grammar (PCFG) approaches. Consequently, a significant portion of cybersecurity research focuses on password creation, storage, and protection, including hashing, encryption, and authentication mechanisms. Most modern online platforms enforce strict, rule‑based password policies, including popular frameworks like zxcvbn; however, these rules can still result in predictable patterns that weaken security, leading users to create passwords that remain vulnerable to automated attacks. In this context, weak passwords are those that are easily guessable by algorithmic methods rather than relying on human intuition. This research proposes a novel, reliable, and accurate method for evaluating password strength based on real‑world cracking techniques. Our approach incorporates extensive feature engineering applied to the RockYou leaked password dataset, consisting of over 14 million passwords, followed by the training of an XGBoost regression model to assess password strength using more than twenty extracted features.
